The package provides a model class and implements sequential Monte Carlo estimation methods. Sofar the iterated batch importance sampling method (http://biomet.oxfordjournals.org/content/89/3/539.abstract) is implemented for static and dynamic models. This procedure is only feasable in case the likelihood is available in closed form.
